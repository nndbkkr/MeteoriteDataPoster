Poster Datavisualization of Meteorite Landings on Earth

Source of data:
https://open.nasa.gov/open-data/ <br>
--> https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh

<h1> DATA </h1>
The data that is used is found on the Open Nasa - open data website. <br>
The JSON file that they provide was a browser version that I couldn't really work with, so I downloaded the CSV file and converted it into a JSON file by using Mr. Data Converter (https://shancarter.github.io/mr-data-converter/) and I cleaned the file up by using a beautifier (http://jsbeautifier.org/)

<h3> Data in the File </h3>
_ name<br>
_ id<br>
_ nametype<br>
_ recclass<br>
_ mass (g)<br>
_ fall<br>
_ year<br>
_ reclat<br>
_ reclong<br>
_ GeoLocation<br>
<br>
